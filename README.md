# About Unshared Projects
| :warning: WARNING          |
|:---------------------------|
| Currently, these are only possible changes by the Scratch Team, but extremely likely. For the most information, read on. |

You probably know that sites such as [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org/) can give you unlimited access to unshared projects. Usually this is used for working on collabs, because you can share projects and share progress easily. This is occasionally used to steal projects or gain unwanted access to projects.

The Scratch Team is likely to introduce a new way of accessing unshared projects, one that only the creator can use. However, when there are limitations, there are usually loopholes. This new change would use tokens to access the project API, tokens that only the project creators have access to, and tokens that the users don't even have to come into contact with.

Theoretically, if these tokens were shared, you could share access to unshared projects. Before we continue, we want to make one thing clear:

| :boom: IMPORTANT |
|:---------------------------|
| **YOU SHOULD NEVER SHARE YOUR PASSWORD AND PRIVATE COOKIES WITH ANY OTHER WEBSITE- IF THEY DO, IT'S A SCAM, BECAUSE THEY WON'T NEED THEM** |

Many developers rely on accessing unshared projects for their projects. As of right now, thousands of developers are scrambling to find alternatives to their current way of accessing projects, as this one won't work anymore. These platforms are important to have, as the entire point of Scratch is to collaborate and share ideas.

You might be wondering how we know all of this. Scratch is a mostly open-sourced website, and so you can access a lot of their advancements and ideas from GitHub. You can find the [official press release here.](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-www/pull/6773)
